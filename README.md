Eerie Code's Custom Cards

This repository will contain the following things:
- Scripts for custom cards I've created
- Scripts for custom cards I've found online, mostly on the Organization forums or Neo Ark Cradle, and found interesting enough to try
- Prerelease for some of the new official cards (done on the fly, most definitely full of bugs)

The latest beta cards can be found here:
http://eeriecode.altervista.org/tools/ecu2_beta_converter.php

A full list of the custom cards can be found here:
http://eeriecode.altervista.org/lab/disk/ec3_list.php

All of these cards are being scripted merely for fun: most of them aren't likely to be officially released on Ygopro's forums anytime soon.
